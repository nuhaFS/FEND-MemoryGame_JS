## Dependencies:
	- Font Awesome: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css
	- Google Fonts: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda
	- jQuery: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js

## To play the game:
	1- Download fendProject_memoryGame.zip folder.
	2- After you unzip the folder, open index.html in your browser.

	Now you can start the game.

## How To Play

	Once you open the index.html file, the game will start. Click on cards and try to match them.
	You will be able to know how good is your memory by completing the game in the shortest amount of time
	and the number of stars you earn according to the number of your moves.
	

## How rating works:
	- Matching cards in 20 moves = 3 stars.
	- Matching cards in 20-30 moves = 2 stars.
	- Matching cards in more than 30 moves = 1 star.
